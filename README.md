# LipNet-Project-
* Lip-Net is a deep learning project that focuses on speech recognition using lip movements. 

* It uses convolutional and recurrent neural networks to recognize spoken words by analysing the corresponding lip movements.

* LipNet is a complex project that requires a deep understanding of deep learning, speech recognition, and computer vision.
